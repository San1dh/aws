# aws-s3-dynamic-page
Hosting an initial static page in AWS S3. Then making it dynamic with the help of AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway &amp; RDB. 

Files are not in any proper order. Just had time to setup the connection & check if it worked. 

Tried using Terraform to automate the AWS services but could not connect to it.
